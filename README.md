<h1>"SINE-MON"</h1>
<p>SINE-MON is an interation of the popular Hasbro game "Simon". </p>
<p>I've been dabbiling using synthesizers and picked up one recently that's a modern copy of one of my favorite sounding vintage synthesizers, the Juno-60. The overall look of the game is based on the look of the Juno-60. For this project I wanted to implement a sample of it's tones. I partially modified a SINE wave tone on my synth and used it for the button tones as well as the arpeggiated intro song. </p>
