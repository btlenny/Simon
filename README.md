# <SINE-MON>
SINE-MON is an interation of the popular Hasbro game "Simon". 
I've been dabbiling in synthesizers and picked up one recently that'ss a modern copy of one of my favorite sounding vintage synthesizers, the Juno-60. The overall look of the game is based on the look of the Juno-60. For this project I wanted to implement a sample of it's tones. I partially modified a sine wave tone on my synthesize and used it for the button tones as well as the arpeggiated intro song.
