# Summary
<p>SINE-MON is an iteration of the popular Hasbro game "Simon". </p>
<p>I've been dabbiling using synthesizers and picked up one recently that's a modern copy of one of my favorite sounding vintage synthesizers, the Juno-60. The overall look of the game is based on the look of the Juno-60. For this project I wanted to implement a sample of it's tones. I partially modified a SINE wave tone on my synth and used it for the button tones as well as the arpeggiated intro song. Hope you enjoy this take on Simon!</p>

# Getting Started

1. Begin by clicking start
2. After the intro music has played the computer will select it's first tile and "Level: 1 of 14" will appear.
3. The player must select the same tile that the computer selects in order to continue
4. The computer will then add an additional tile to it's sequence and continue up to a pattern of 14 random tiles that the player must mimic in order to win the game.
5. If you lose or win, you can replay again by hitting start

# Next Steps

- If a player clicks to quickly it will say you lost. I will update so that even the fastest players won't have issue
